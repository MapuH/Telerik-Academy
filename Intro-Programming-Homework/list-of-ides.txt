1. Visual Studio
Visual Studio is Microsoft's IDE. If you're building Silverlight apps or planning on working in a .NET shop, you may want to spend some time with Visual Studio. Visual Basic has some support for non-Microsoft languages such as Python and Ruby, but you'll have to install those services yourself.

2. Eclipse
Eclipse is the free and open-source editor upon which many development frameworks are based. It's one of the granddaddies in its field and comes highly recommended by many a professional developer. Eclipse began as a Java development environment and has greatly expanded through a system of lightweight plugins.

3. NetBeans
NetBeans is neck-and-neck with Eclipse as the most-recommended IDE in this category. It's free and open-source, supports tons of languages with more plugins coming all the time, and is incredibly simple to install and use, even for a beginner.

4. Text editor based IDEs - Notepad++, Vim, Sublime Text, etc.
